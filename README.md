# eip-ero-register-checker-api
Spring Boot microservice that is :
- Consuming and handling SQS messages related to applicant's register checks.
- Exposing secured REST APIs to allow search and update operations related to applicant's register checks.

# External api dependencies
- Soft-wire IER api 
- [eip-ero-management-api](https://github.com/communitiesuk/eip-ero-management-api)

## Developer Setup
### Kotlin API Developers

Configure your IDE with the code formatter (ktlint):
```
$ ./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea
```
This only needs doing once to setup your IDE with the code styles.

#### AWS CodeArtifact Access Set Up

To access libraries stored in the AWS CodeArtifact repository an access token is required that the build script fetches
in the background using the credentials for the `code-artifact` profile. To create this profile on your developer
machine follow these instructions:

```shell
aws configure --profile code-artifact
```

At the prompts configure the `code-artifact` profile as follows:
* Your AWS Access Key ID
* Your AWS Secret Access Key
* Default region name, `eu-west-2`
* Default output format, `json`

Note: AWS CLI must be installed on the developer workstation as a pre-requisite.

#### Running Tests

```
$ ./gradlew check
```

This will run the tests and ktlint. (Be warned, ktlint will hurt your feelings!)

#### Building docker images
```
$ ./gradlew check bootBuildImage
```
This will build a docker image for the Spring Boot application.

## Running the application
Either `./gradlew bootRun` or run the class `RegisterCheckerApiApplication`
