      GSS Codes are a ONS concept. The GSS Codes used in IER closely
      relate to those but do not always match the current ONS codes.
      All applications are assigned a GSS Code based on the registered
      address of the applicant.

  nameVac:
    description: The name printed on the physical Voter Authority Certificate. 
      Must be the legal name of the issuing LA. This name will not necessarily match up 
      with the usual name that an LA goes by. This name should only be used on the 
      certificate itself, and within EROP where the certificate details are previewed. Everywhere 
      else should use the existing name field, as this is individual to the LA which the 
      legal name may not be (VJBs have the same legal name for all of the constituent LAs).
      Required if name exceeds 90 characters;; if not specified, the existing name field will be used.

  emailAddressVac:

      queries. Required if email field exceeds 50 chars; if not specified, the existing

  urlVac:
    description: URL to be used on certificates, and for all correspondence
      relating to VAC apps, i.e. in confirmation emails. Normal URLs 
      (i.e. the ones used for RTV) generally exceed the 50 character limit imposed 
      by the printers, so for printing on certs we use shortened URLs, often shortened 
      to just end at .gov.uk. Required if url exceeds 50 chars; if not specified, 
      the existing url field will be used.
