  Used for the proxy vote reason in proxy applications.
  This mainly reflects the type of voter. The non-"other" types listed here qualify
  for a proxy vote due to their status. Applicants who answer "other" here will need
  to provide a justification in `proxyVoteReasonAdditionalText`.
  Applicants who answer "educational-course", "employment" or "disability" are only
  able to apply for a proxy vote on a single day. To apply for a proxy vote for a longer
  period, they must apply via paper form.
