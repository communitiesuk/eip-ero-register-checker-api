            A static value that can be used by EMSs to add additional business logic if needed.
            The current values are below but may change overtime, hence this is not an enforced restricted list / enum.
            Should we add a new 'type' or revise one, we would not want EMSs to require a deployment.
            As such these values should not be used for business logic in processing applications, 
            but could be used for aggregations of rejection reasons across applications.

            This is false for any reason that should not be included in comms.
