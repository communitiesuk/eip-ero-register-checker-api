      The path the ERO user was on before they clicked the feedback link,
      if available.
      The EROP UI should strip any query string parameters which may contain
      sensitive data.
      It should include any query string parameters which are required to
      understand the action which the user was taking at the time they left
      feedback.
      It may choose to strip any query string parameters which are unimportant
      in order to make the feedback easier to group by page.
